				<h1>&lt;The War in Ukraine&gt;</h1>
				<p>&lt;"The constant Russian invasions of Ukraine have transformed the disagreement into a war, yet the tension between these two nations has been falling for a long time. This year has seen a flurry of fresh assaults and increased hostility between these countries. It's catastrophic, and it's startling the entire globe."&gt;</p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;&gt;Russia's conflict in Ukraine is a humanitarian catastrophe. Aside from that, the economic harm is already being felt throughout the world and is expected to get worse and endure longer. Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24th has cast doubt on the region's recovery from the COVID 19 epidemic and sown disaster, destroying lives, homes, and infrastructure. The world is on the Ukraine side, refugee support is available worldwide and the globe is really coming together to support the Ukraine.  </p>

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;In the midst of the uncertainty, the OECD predicts that global economic growth will be more than 1% lower this year than expected before the conflict, and that inflation, which was already high at the start of the year, will be higher than it would have been if the conflict had not broken out by at least 2.5 percentage points on a country-by-country basis.Energy costs have risen drastically since Russia supplies roughly 19 percent of the world's natural gas and 11% of the world's oil. The European Union, in particular, is reliant on Russian gas and oil. Gas spot prices in Europe are now more than ten times higher than they were a year ago, while oil prices have nearly doubled. The price shock has the potential to exacerbate poverty and disrupt global production of goods and services.&gt;</p>
